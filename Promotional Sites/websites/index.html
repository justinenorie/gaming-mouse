                    <h1>Logitech G502 Lightspeed</h1>
                    <p>The Logitech G502 Hero was a hit with PCWorld reviewers before it went wireless because of its comfortable design, well-thought-out button layout and convenient dual-mode scroll. Thankfully all these features return in the update, but the G502 now has Powerplay compatibility—a feature we can’t speak highly enough of. </p>

                    <h1>Razer Viper Mini Signature Edition</h1>
                    <p>Every once in a while a gaming mouse pops up that blows my mind with how good a value it is. Not only does it sport dual wireless connectivity in the form of low-latency 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 5.1, it also has wired connectivity via a USB cable. Adding to that is a very powerful 26,000 DPI sensor with flawless tracking and some of the quickest buttons.</p>

                    <p>The G903’s is design that lends itself equally to left- and right-handed gaming. There are 10 buttons in all, and you can set up the outer edge buttons to match your dominant hand. Additionally, the left and right buttons fire on a hair trigger with the slightest amount of pressure, so if firing off commands quickly is important to you, this mouse has you covered.</p>

                    <p>The ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition is the very epitome of high-end materials engineering, made with a nylon body instead of a plastic one. This means it substantially undercuts the weight of other esports mice with Tri-Mode connectivity (2.4GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and wired connectivity) to weigh just 54 grams. You can take it anywhere and it’ll connect to just about all your devices.</p>

                    <p>The Logitech G203 resembles more expensive esports mice with its simple 6-button configuration, small body and ambidextrous shape, but despite being substantially cheaper than rivals, it still feels sturdy and well-built. The G203’s 8,000 DPI sensor isn’t the quickest you’ll find, but for causal gamers it’s still a more than adequate performer that tracks accurately.</p>
